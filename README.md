# shavit's simple bhop timer
a bhop server should be simple

[Mapzones' setup demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPKso2hoLw0)

# Requirements:
* [SourceMod 1.8 and above](http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php)
* `clientprefs` plugin/extension. Comes built-in with SourceMod.
* [The RTLer](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1649882) is required to *compile* `shavit-chat` and you don't need Simple Chat Processor as listed in Ther RTLer's requirements.
* [Dynamic](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=270519) for compilation and runtime of `shavit-chat`.
* [Simple Chat Processor \(Redux\)](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1820365) - for compilation and better runtime of `shavit-chat` (plugin can run without it). Use the scp.inc file I attached in `include/scp.inc` for transitional syntax support.

# Optional requirements:
* [DHooks](http://users.alliedmods.net/~drifter/builds/dhooks/2.0/) - required for static 250 prestrafe.
* [The RTLer](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1649882) - required for properly formatted RTL text within `shavit-chat`.
* [Simple Chat Processor \(Redux\)](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1820365) - for more proper parsing inside `shavit-chat`.

#  Installation:
1. Add a database entry in addons/sourcemod/configs/databases.cfg, call it "shavit"
```
"Databases"
{
	"driver_default"		"mysql"

	// When specifying "host", you may use an IP address, a hostname, or a socket file path

	"default"
	{
		"driver"			"default"
		"host"				"localhost"
		"database"			"sourcemod"
		"user"				"root"
		"pass"				""
		//"timeout"			"0"
		//"port"			"0"
	}

	"shavit"
	{
		"driver"         "mysql"
		"host"           "localhost"
		"database"       "shavit"
		"user"           "root"
		"pass"           ""
	}
}
```
2. Copy the desired .smx files to your plugins (addons/sourcemod/plugins) folder  
2.1. Copy shavit.games.txt to /gamedata if you have DHooks installed.
3. Copy base.nav to the `maps` folder.
4. Copy the files from the `sound` folder to the one on your server. Make sure to also have equivelant bz2 files on your FastDL server!  
4.1. Do the same for the `materials` folder.
5. Copy the `configs` file to your server and modify `shavit-sounds.cfg` if you wish to.  
5.1. Changing `shavit-prefix.txt` to contain your MySQL database prefix might be needed depending on your usage.
6. Restart your server.

# Required plugins:
`shavit-core` - no other plugin will work without it.  
`shavit-zones` - required for `shavit-core` and for `shavit-misc`.  
`shavit-wr` - required for `shavit-stats`, `shavit-replay`, `shavit-sounds`, `shavit-stats` and `shavit-rankings`.  
`shavit-rankings` - required for `shavit-chat`.
